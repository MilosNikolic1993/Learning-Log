Project Description: The "Learning Log" project is an online journal system that allows users to track the information they have learned about various topics.

The application is developed using Python and the Django framework, while the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Technologies and Tools:

Python: The main programming language for the development of the application.
Django: A web framework for building applications and working with databases.
PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing information about the journal.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Tools for building the user interface.
Platform.sh: A platform for deploying and hosting the application in the cloud.
Git: Version control for managing the codebase.
Scoop: A package manager for installing tools on Windows.
